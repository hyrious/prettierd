# Sublime Text Plugin Prettierd

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) integration for Sublime Text, providing faster <q>format on save</q>.

## Why?

[JsPrettier](https://github.com/jonlabelle/SublimeJsPrettier) is very slow.
It blocks your main thread.

This plugin solves this problem by spawning a prettier daemon.

## Install

You don't have to install JsPrettier to use this plugin.

This plugin **ONLY** supports Sublime Text 4 currently. Sorry for st2/st3 users.
If you want it to work on st2/st3, welcome to submit a PR!

Make sure you have installed `node` and `prettier` (with `npm i -g`) globally.
