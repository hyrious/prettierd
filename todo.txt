- [ ] Figure out how to listen to file rename then query file info again.

      The Default/rename.py just invokes the system call and
      do "view.retarget(filename)". It doesn't give me a listener (I guess).

- [ ] Add settings to temporarily/permanently treat
      one file extension as some parser.
      e.g. `.prettierrc` -> use json parser (prettier uses yaml by default)
      maybe "overrides": { ".prettierrc": "json" }

- [ ] Add support to format range(s) of code. (low priority)
