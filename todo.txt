TODO
----

- [x] Better detect `.prettierrc` and call "clear cache" automatically.

- [x] Add settings to change the TCP port.

- [x] Figure out how to close child process (zombie) on sublime exit.

- [x] Minify "replace" works by diff-match-patch.

- [ ] Add settings to temporarily/permanently treat
      one file extension as some parser.
      e.g. `.prettierrc` -> use json parser (prettier uses yaml by default)

- [ ] Add support to format range(s) of code.
