- [ ] Figure out how to listen to file rename then query file info again.

      The Default/rename.py just invokes the system call and
      do "view.retarget(filename)". It doesn't give me a listener (I guess).

- [ ] Add support to format range(s) of code. (low priority)

- [ ] It is possible to publish as a sublime-package -- write prettierd.mjs
      to the cache folder then execute it there. But I'm too lazy to do so.
