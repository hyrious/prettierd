- [ ] Figure out how to listen to file rename then query file info again.

      The Default/rename.py just invokes the system call and
      do "view.retarget(filename)". It doesn't give me a listener (I guess).

- [ ] Add settings to temporarily/permanently treat
      one file extension as some parser.
      e.g. `.prettierrc` -> use json parser (prettier uses yaml by default)
      maybe "overrides": { ".prettierrc": "json" }

- [ ] Add support to format range(s) of code. (low priority)

- [ ] It is possible to publish as a sublime-package -- write prettierd.mjs
      to the cache folder then execute it there. But I'm too lazy to do so.

- [ ] Use esbuild as a formatter? This is possible for all JS/CSS variants.
      The easist way to do so is extending prettierd.mjs so that we don't
      have to change prettierd.py.
