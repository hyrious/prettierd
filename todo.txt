- [x] Refactor async format through `async` keywords.

      I mis-understood the `sublime.set_timeout_async()` works -- It doesn't
      mean the same as `Thread().start()`, instead it moves the callback to
      a SINGLE SHARED thread. Which means there're only 2 threads provided
      by sublime plugin api -- The main UI thread and the worker thread.

      Anything scheduled in the worker thread will block each other.
      -- https://github.com/SublimeText/sublime_lib/issues/90

      Note that request is still using the worker thread since
      they are not occupying too much time.

- [ ] Figure out how to listen to file rename then query file info again.

      The Default/rename.py just invokes the system call and
      do "view.retarget(filename)". It doesn't give me a listener (I guess).

- [ ] Add settings to temporarily/permanently treat
      one file extension as some parser.
      e.g. `.prettierrc` -> use json parser (prettier uses yaml by default)

- [ ] Add support to format range(s) of code.
